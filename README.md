# RQ-1 – Quadruped Robot

**RQ-1** (Rajib Quadruped – 1) is a four-legged walking robot designed and developed by **Rajib Hasan** under the initiative *Robotics With Rajib*. The robot uses servo motors for movement and a microcontroller-based system to control the leg motions.

This project aims to explore quadrupedal locomotion in robotics using basic electronics and embedded programming.
